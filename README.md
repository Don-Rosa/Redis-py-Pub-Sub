A simple implementation of the Redis Pub/Sub with redis-py and tkinter

Requirements :

- A runing redis server ;→ ```redis-server```
- The redis-py python package ;→ ```pip install redis```
- Run the single python file ;→ ```python3 Redis_PubSub.py```


Look README.pdf for a detailed how to use
(It was for a school project, so I think the report will do a fine README)
